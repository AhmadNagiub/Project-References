### Description

Since I learned a lot of technologies and applied several projects with these technologies, I realized that it is
confusing to explore my projects on GitHub, so I decided to make this reference markdown file where I can introduce my
projects in an ordered way that enable you to explore them and track my progress easily.

> There is a `README.md` file for every project or application in its repository which explain every thing about it
